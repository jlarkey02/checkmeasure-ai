# Docker Build Status

## ðŸš€ First Build in Progress

The Docker containers are currently being built. This is normal and expected for the first build.

### What's Happening:

1. **Backend Build** (Python 3.11)
   - Installing system dependencies (gcc, g++, curl)
   - Installing Python packages (FastAPI, PyMuPDF, etc.)
   - Setting up health checks

2. **Frontend Build** (Node 18)
   - Installing npm packages
   - Setting up React development environment
   - Configuring hot reload

### Expected Time: 5-10 minutes

### Once Complete:

The services will start automatically and you'll be able to access:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Monitor Progress:

```bash
# Check build status
./monitor-build.sh

# View logs
make logs

# Check container status
docker-compose ps
```

### Benefits:

âœ… No more backend deaths after idle
âœ… Consistent environment
âœ… Automatic restarts on failure
âœ… Persistent PDF storage
âœ… Resource limits prevent memory issues

The build only needs to happen once. Future starts will be much faster!
