## ❌ Failed Approaches

### Direct Package Import
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Time Lost**: 0.5h
- **Why Failed**: Backend crashed due to missing `anthropic` package
- **Lesson Learned**: Always check requirements.txt for all imports
- **What to Try Instead**: Install missing packages before running

### FormData with Explicit Content-Type
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Time Lost**: 1h
- **Why Failed**: Setting 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' manually doesn't include boundary parameter
- **Lesson Learned**: Let axios/fetch auto-set Content-Type for FormData
- **What to Try Instead**: Remove Content-Type header or set to undefined

### Ant Design File Upload originFileObj
- **Date**: 2025-07-28
- **Time Lost**: 0.5h
- **Why Failed**: Assumed file.originFileObj existed, but beforeUpload gives raw File object
- **Lesson Learned**: Check actual object structure with console.log before accessing properties
- **What to Try Instead**: Use the file object directly from beforeUpload

### Line Coordinate Drawing Approach
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Time Lost**: 2h
- **Why Failed**: AI-provided pixel coordinates are imprecise, PDF orientation issues
- **Lesson Learned**: Don't rely on AI for exact positioning; use bounding boxes instead
- **What to Try Instead**: Area selection with visual confirmation

### Automatic Full-PDF Analysis
- **Date**: 2025-07-29  
- **Time Lost**: 1.5h
- **Why Failed**: Too ambitious - trying to detect all patterns at once
- **Lesson Learned**: User-guided selection is more accurate and gives control
- **What to Try Instead**: Let users select specific areas for analysis

### Sequential API Calls to Claude Vision
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Time Lost**: 0.5h (ongoing issue)
- **Why Failed**: Pattern detection + measurement detection = 60s+ total time
- **Lesson Learned**: Long requests need proper timeout handling and user feedback
- **What to Try Instead**: Parallel API calls or progressive enhancement

### PDF Conversion Performance Issue
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Time Lost**: 3h
- **Why Failed**: Converting entire PDF to images before cropping areas
- **Lesson Learned**: Only convert pages that are needed, process on demand
- **What to Try Instead**: Page-by-page conversion based on selected areas
- **Solution**: Grouped areas by page, convert only needed pages

### NoneType Division Errors
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Time Lost**: 1h
- **Why Failed**: Not checking if values are None before division operations
- **Lesson Learned**: Always validate numeric values before arithmetic operations
- **What to Try Instead**: Use defensive coding: `value if value is not None else default`

### KeyError on Dictionary Access
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Time Lost**: 0.5h  
- **Why Failed**: Trying to append to dictionary key that might not exist
- **Lesson Learned**: Check key existence or ensure creation path before appending
- **What to Try Instead**: Proper conditional logic for key creation

### UI Stuck on Analyzing State
- **Date**: 2025-07-29
- **Time Lost**: 0.5h
- **Why Failed**: No else clause when API returns empty detected_elements
- **Lesson Learned**: Handle all response scenarios, including empty results
- **What to Try Instead**: Always update UI state even for empty responses

## 🔬 Hypothesis vs Reality Tracking

### Issue: Intermittent Connection Refused Errors (2025-08-01)

#### Initial Hypothesis
- **Root Cause Theory**: Heavy calculator imports + PDF memory leaks cause backend crashes
- **Evidence**: 
  - Errors occur after element types load successfully
  - PDF processing opens multiple documents without cleanup
  - Backend becomes unreachable, suggesting process crash
- **Proposed Solution**:
  1. Lazy loading for calculators to prevent heavy startup
  2. Fix resource management in PDF processing with proper cleanup
  3. Add health monitoring and exception handling

#### Implementation Plan
- **Task 1**: Add lazy calculator loading in factory
- **Task 2**: Fix PDF resource cleanup with try-finally blocks
- **Task 3**: Add exception handling to prevent crashes
- **Task 4**: Test and verify the fix

#### Reality Check (Updated 2025-08-01)

##### Initial Results (Partial Success! 🎉)
- **First Request**: ✅ Worked perfectly! Joist analysis completed successfully
- **Second Request**: ❌ Failed after taking a break (backend stopped responding)

##### Root Cause Analysis
- **Confirmed Root Cause**: PDF resources not being closed properly in error paths (pdf_doc.close() not in finally blocks)
- **New Discovery**: Backend fails after idle period, suggesting additional issues

##### What Worked
- ✅ Resource cleanup with try-finally blocks prevented immediate crashes
- ✅ Global exception handler prevents crashes from exceptions
- ✅ Lazy loading reduced startup memory footprint
- ✅ First request always works perfectly
- ✅ Element types load successfully

##### What Didn't Work
- ❌ Backend becomes unresponsive after idle time
- ❌ Initial hypothesis about heavy calculator imports was only partially correct
- ❌ Fix didn't address all stability issues

##### Lessons Learned
- Always use try-finally for resource cleanup in Python
- File handles and PDF documents must be explicitly closed
- Global exception handlers are essential for API stability
- Test with the actual user workflow to reproduce issues
- **New Learning**: Some bugs only manifest after time passes (temporal bugs)
- **New Learning**: Need to test idle scenarios, not just immediate usage

##### Time Tracking
- **First Fix**: Estimated 2h, Actual: 45 minutes
- **New Issue Investigation**: In progress...

### Issue: Backend Timeout After Idle Period (2025-08-01)

#### New Hypothesis
- **Root Cause Theory**: Backend process dies or becomes unresponsive after idle period
- **Evidence**:
  - First request works perfectly
  - Backend fails after user takes a break
  - Backend health check returns "not responding"
- **Possible Causes**:
  1. Anthropic client timeout/connection expiry
  2. Memory leak that accumulates over time
  3. Process manager killing idle processes
  4. Database/resource connection timeouts

#### Investigation Plan
- **Task 1**: Add lifecycle logging to track request start/end
- **Task 2**: Monitor memory usage over time
- **Task 3**: Check Anthropic client connection management
- **Task 4**: Implement keep-alive or connection refresh
- **Task 5**: Test with deliberate idle periods

#### Reality Check (Completed 2025-08-01)
- **Actual Root Cause**: Claude Vision API was completely unnecessary!
- **Solution**: Removed Claude Vision entirely - users already select element types manually
- **Prevention**: Don't add AI where simple math works better

### 🎯 MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL SIMPLIFICATION (2025-08-01)

#### The Problem
We discovered that Claude Vision was being used unnecessarily:
- Users already select the element type (J1, J2, etc.) from dropdown
- Users already select the scale manually
- All we needed was to convert mouse coordinates to real dimensions

#### The Solution
1. **Removed Claude Vision completely** - No more 6-7 second API calls
2. **Created simple math endpoint** - `/api/pdf/calculate-dimensions`
3. **Instant calculations** - Mouse coordinates → real dimensions in milliseconds
4. **Zero API costs** - No external dependencies

#### Changes Made
- ✅ New endpoint that only uses PDFScaleCalculator
- ✅ Updated frontend to call new endpoint
- ✅ Removed all "AI analysis" and "confidence" UI elements
- ✅ Removed auto-scale detection (manual only)
- ✅ Commented out anthropic dependency
- ✅ Marked claude_vision_analyzer.py as LEGACY

#### Results
- **Performance**: 6-7 seconds → instant
- **Reliability**: No more connection timeouts
- **Simplicity**: Removed ~500 lines of unnecessary code
- **Cost**: $0 (was using Claude Vision API)
- **User Experience**: Much better - instant feedback

### Cutting List Decimal Display Fix (2025-08-01)

#### The Problem
- Cutting list was showing rounded values (e.g., 3.6m displayed as "4m")
- Using `:.0f` format removed decimal places in display
- Actual calculations were correct, only display was wrong

#### The Solution
- Changed format strings from `:.0f` to `:.1f` in:
  - enhanced_joist_calculator.py (6 locations)
  - base_calculator.py (1 location)

#### Results
- ✅ Cutting list now shows exact lengths: 3.6m, 4.2m, 4.8m, etc.
- ✅ No more confusion about what's being ordered
- ✅ Display matches actual standard timber lengths
