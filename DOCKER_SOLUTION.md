# Docker Solution for Backend Issues

## The Problem
The backend crashes immediately when run directly on macOS due to system-level process management killing Python network processes.

## The Solution: Use Docker (Already Set Up!)

### Quick Start
```bash
cd /Users/andrewlarkey/checkmeasure-ai
docker-compose up --build
```

### Access Points
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Key Docker Commands
```bash
# Start containers
docker-compose up

# Start in background
docker-compose up -d

# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Rebuild after changes
docker-compose up --build
```

### Why Docker Solves This
1. Runs in Linux containers - bypasses macOS issues
2. All dependencies containerized
3. No virtual environment conflicts
4. Consistent environment
5. Already configured and ready to use

### Docker Files Present
- `docker-compose.yml` - Main orchestration
- `backend/Dockerfile` - Python backend container
- `frontend/Dockerfile.dev` - React frontend container
- All necessary configuration files

## Important Note
The project was designed to run in Docker. All the crashes we experienced were from trying to run it directly on macOS instead of using the provided Docker setup.
